# The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## What's inside this project?
This project contains a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. Players can enjoy a game against the computer, with the game determining the winner based on standard rules.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way to play Rock Paper Scissors. It serves as an educational example for implementing a basic game using programming concepts and helps users understand game logic, user input handling, and basic decision-making in software.

## Game Logic
The core game logic is based on simple conditional statements to determine the winner:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
Randomization: The computer's choice is generated using a random selection algorithm to ensure fairness and unpredictability.

## How it Works
User Input: The player is prompted to enter their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
Comparison: The player's choice is compared with the computer's choice based on the game logic.
Result Announcement: The result (win, lose, or tie) is displayed to the player.
